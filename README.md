# MLFeatureExtractorGo\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SuicideCode/MLFeatureExtractorGo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SuicideCode/MLFeatureExtractorGo)\n\nMLFeatureExtractorGo is a powerful, stateless, and deterministic feature extractor implemented in Go for machine learning use-cases.\n\nThe text feature extractor uses a hashing vectorizer heavily enabling swift feature extraction with very low overhead. This approach of hash vectorizing doesn't entail any state storage and maintains consistency thus boasts the following advantages:\n\n- Fast, owing to the lack of need for pre-processing or look-ups as hashing vectorizer creates feature IDs\n- Economical memory usage even with large volumes of data - no index or state data stored\n- Can be scaled horizontally easily - no stored state negates the need for coordination\n- Ability to add features and values at a later date\n\nIt's important to note that these advantages are not without their costs. MLFeatureExtractorGo does not support transformations like Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) for text features, which can be useful to diminish the effect of common text features. If this significantly impacts your algorithm or dataset's prediction, consider adding this support or explore a different approach or tool. Other optimizations like number scaling can be implemented given some basic number data metrics from your datastore, such as the dataset's maximum value.\n\n## Output format\n\n[libsvm format](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/61328/libsvm-data-format) (`<index_number>:<value>`)\nA slice of them, if the feature generates multiple vectors (text, timestamp, date).\nThis format makes this library easy to use along with [hector](https://github.com/xlvector/hector)\n\n## Supported data\n\n- IP - Converted to integer representation (preserves locality) and min/max scaled\n- timestamp - Represented as 3 seasonality vectors: minute of hour, hour of day, day of week\n- date - Represented as 2 seasonality vectors: day of week, and month of year\n- text - Tokenized by word and one-hot encoded using hashing vectorizer\n- numerical - Utilizes log scaler (default), or min/max rescaler\n- boolean - represented as 0 or 1\n- categorical - Untokenized but one-hot encoded using a hashing vectorizer\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Godocs and tests\n\n[godocs](https://godoc.org/github.com/SuicideCode/MLFeatureExtractorGo)\n\nLook at the [included example](example/main.go) and the tests for exemplary usage.\n\n### Using MLFeatureExtractorGo\n\nFor each incoming processed sample, `append` the returned string or expanded slice to a `features` slice.\nTo assemble the final sample in libsvm format, just sort and join it with the sample label:\n\n``` go\nsort.Strings(features)\nsample := "0 " + strings.Join(features, " ")\n```
